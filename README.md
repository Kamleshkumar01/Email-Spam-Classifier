## Email Spam Classifier

SecureMail Classifier is a machine learning project developed to classify emails into spam and non-spam categories. This project utilizes natural language processing and machine learning techniques to create an effective solution for filtering unwanted emails.

## Overview

Email spam continues to be a prevalent issue, causing inconvenience and potential security risks. The goal of this project is to provide a reliable classifier that can accurately identify and categorize emails, ensuring a clean and secure inbox experience for users.

## Key Features

- **Text Classification Model:** Implements a text classification model to analyze the content of emails and predict whether they are spam or not.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Applies comprehensive data preprocessing techniques, including text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction, to prepare the dataset for model training.

- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Utilizes machine learning algorithms, such as Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machines, to train a robust model. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

- **User Interface (Optional):** Provides a user-friendly interface for users to input text and receive real-time predictions, enhancing practical usability.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Email Spam-Not Spam Classifier, follow these steps:

1. **Dataset:** Obtain a labeled dataset containing examples of spam and non-spam emails. Ensure the dataset is diverse and representative of real-world scenarios.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Run the data preprocessing script to clean and prepare the dataset for model training.

3. **Model Training:** Train the text classification model using the prepared dataset.

4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

5. **Deployment (Optional):** Optionally, deploy the model as part of a spam filter system, integrating it into email clients or servers.

## Usage

To use the Email Spam-Not Spam Classifier, follow the guidelines provided in the documentation. This may include using pre-trained models or training a new model based on specific requirements.

## SecureMail Classifier

SecureMail Classifier is a machine learning project developed to classify emails into spam and non-spam categories. This project utilizes natural language processing and machine learning techniques to create an effective solution for filtering unwanted emails.

## Overview

Email spam continues to be a prevalent issue, causing inconvenience and potential security risks. The goal of this project is to provide a reliable classifier that can accurately identify and categorize emails, ensuring a clean and secure inbox experience for users.

## Key Features

- **Text Classification Model:** Implements a text classification model to analyze the content of emails and predict whether they are spam or not.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Applies comprehensive data preprocessing techniques, including text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction, to prepare the dataset for model training.

- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Utilizes machine learning algorithms, such as Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machines, to train a robust model. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

- **User Interface (Optional):** Provides a user-friendly interface for users to input text and receive real-time predictions, enhancing practical usability.
